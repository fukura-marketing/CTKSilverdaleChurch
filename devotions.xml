<p>To be &#8220;in the dark&#8221; means that you are unaware of the truth about something. And if someone &#8220;sheds some light&#8221; on the subject, that means they helped you to understand what you didn&#8217;t know before.</p>
<p>But for the Christians in the city of Ephesus, the apostle Paul extended the metaphor to the extreme. Paul told those believers that in their past not only were they in the dark about God and his will for their lives, but they were the darkness! They had so deeply swallowed the lies of godlessness and the empty temptations of this world that they became a corrupting influence in the lives of others as well.</p>
<p>All of us were born in the same darkness of sin and unbelief. None of us came into this world knowing the truth about God&#8217;s love for us. And our sinful human nature actively works to try to keep us in that spiritual darkness. When we follow those self-destructive patterns in our lives, we can cause others around us to stumble too.</p>
<p>But the light of Christ shines brightly to scatter the darkness. Jesus Christ came to reveal the truth about God, about ourselves, and about how we have been made right with God through the sacrifice of his Son. The Holy Spirit enlightens our hearts through this good news and leads us to rejoice in what it means for us.</p>
<p>Just as those in the dark are darkness to others, so those in the light of Christ also become a source of light. Christians have learned what kind of living pleases God: a life full of love and compassion for others, a life that seeks to serve God and our neighbor, a life that revolves around the truth of our Savior, Jesus. When we walk according to the light of the Bible, our actions and attitudes serve as beacons for others, calling them to know the will of God for their lives and how true spiritual light is found in Jesus.</p>

<p>Remember those miners in Chile who were trapped underground for 69 days back in 2010? Picture them before the first small drill broke through: running out of food, water, and light as batteries died… trapped in darkness so deep in the earth. It might be fun to visit and explore a cave, but it must be terrifying to be trapped in the dark, totally dependent upon someone else to rescue you.</p>
<p>Imagine being caught in an even worse never-ending darkness! That&#8217;s the darkness of being separated from God, of being trapped in sin and captive to eternal death. It is the darkness into which all of us were born, the Bible tells us. </p>
<p>But Jesus broke through that dense darkness with the bright light of salvation which he accomplished by his suffering and death for us all. Through his Word, God has called us out of the darkness of unbelief into the wonderful light of faith in Jesus. God has turned us from darkness into being &#8220;light in the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now he calls upon us to live in that light, to let our faith shine. In thanks to Jesus for rescuing us from the darkness of hell, we let the brightness of Christ shine through us and expose the darkness around us. Jesus has made us beacons of light to those still in spiritual darkness. For his sake, we will seek to live in ways that please our God, being as good, decent, and honest as we possibly can. And light up the world with the good news of Jesus.</p>
<p>As his believers, it&#8217;s time to shine!</p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>

Dear Jesus, thank you for bringing the light of heaven into my life through your perfect life, death, and resurrection! Shine through me so that I can light up the world around me! Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>Someone is always watching you. Are you okay with that?</p>
<p>Many facilities, both public and private, are equipped with video surveillance systems. They see, and may even record, where and when you come in and go out. They watch what you are doing and how you are doing it. Are you okay with that?</p>
<p>As you use your mobile phone and data plan or surf the internet, where you go and what you do may be tracked and recorded for future reference and analysis. Websites track your patterns and habits. Retailers note when, how, where, and what you shop for.</p>
<p>Your cell phone use and your cell signal can be monitored. The methods and the technology for watching where you go and what you do continue to evolve. Are you okay with that?</p>
<p>Sometimes we don&#8217;t realize that things like video surveillance and online tracking are taking place. At other times we realize it is happening, but don&#8217;t give it much thought. Here&#8217;s a truth worth thinking about—all the time: The Lord is watching over your coming and going. He is watching over you right now, at every moment, all the time.</p>
<p>Whether you realize it or not, whether you think about it or not, the Lord is watching over your life. The God of faithful love is watching over you and keeping you from harm. The God who loves you does not slumber nor sleep. He is always looking to bless you.</p>
<p>What a wonderful comfort! While you are awake and when you are sleeping, when you are coming and when you are going, no matter where you are or what you are doing, the Lord is watching over you. The Maker of heaven and earth who has made you his child in Christ is there to help you every step of the way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m absolutely okay with that. I hope you are too.</p>

Lord, let your favor rest on me,<br />
And give me peace eternally. Amen.<br />

<p>People sometimes become frustrated with God because they don&#8217;t feel their faith is working in the way it should.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried going to church and doing the right things. But life is still really hard, and God doesn&#8217;t seem to be changing anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried not to worry and to stop trying to control everything, but it seems that only left me with fewer answers and more questions. It&#8217;s not working, and I don’t think it should be so hard to follow him.&#8221; But sometimes it is. And if it ever is for you, then look at Abram.</p>
<p>Abram received many wonderful promises from God but saw precious few of those promises fulfilled during his lifetime. Abram&#8217;s family didn&#8217;t take possession of the land God promised him until 430 years later. Abram was long dead by then. And this &#8220;great nation&#8221; that he would make Abram to be; when Abram died, had exactly one son and two 15-year-old grandchildren; none of whom were the Savior of the world, which is exactly what God was talking about when he said that &#8220;all people on earth will be blessed through [him].&#8221;</p>
<p>Abram would never see, during his life on earth, most of the blessings God promised him. Yet he still went where God commanded him, even when it was hard because he trusted God to keep his word.</p>
<p>You can trust his word too. Even when things aren&#8217;t going the way you would like, even when God seems slow in keeping his promises to you, you can trust he will. After all, he kept his greatest promise when he sent his Son into the world to save you from your sins.<em> If he was willing to keep that promise, you can be sure he will keep all the rest.</em></p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Father in heaven, strengthen my faith in you by keeping me focused on your faithfulness to me in Jesus. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>Consider some of the promises Abraham believed in, as repeated by the Apostle Paul in the book of Romans. Paul called Abraham&#8217;s God the &#8220;God who justifies the wicked.&#8221; To justify means to declare &#8220;not guilty.&#8221; And if God saw the wicked things Abraham did and called him not guilty of them, then Abraham had the right to walk through life believing that God was never going to punish him for anything.</p>
<p>Paul said that Abraham&#8217;s God is the one who &#8220;gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they are,&#8221; which means that Abraham had the right to look at death and expect life. He had the right to look at situations that aren&#8217;t good and expect that good will still come from them.</p>
<p>Paul also said that these promises are &#8220;guaranteed to all Abraham&#8217;s offspring,&#8221; and he defines Abraham&#8217;s offspring not as those who are of the same bloodline as him, but as anyone who has the same faith Abraham did.</p>
<p>If you believe in the same God Abraham did, it means that whenever death claims your body, it won&#8217;t be the end since your God brings life from death. And since he calls things that are not as though they are, then you also have the right to look at situations that are not good and believe that some good will still come from them.</p>
<p>And remember, all of these promises are &#8220;guaranteed.&#8221; They were guaranteed through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, who perfectly fulfilled every promise God made about him.</p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Father in heaven, help me to hold on to your remarkable promises so that I stand firm in my faith. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>There is a difference between a gift and an obligation.</p>
<p>If you have a job and put in your required hours, your boss has an obligation to give you a paycheck. The paycheck is earned. But a gift is given under no obligation. The recipient did not earn it.</p>
<p>This is the point the Bible makes about Abraham. God was not obligated to bless him. Abraham was &#8220;ungodly&#8221; in many of the same ways we are. He was imperfect, sinned, and fell short of doing all that God requires. God was under no obligation to bless Abraham, and he is under no obligation to bless us.</p>
<p>And yet he did bless Abraham. He gave him great wealth and fame. He made him the father of a great nation. And, most importantly, he made him the ancestor of Jesus, the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>God has done the same for us. Although he is under no obligation to bless us, he has. He has given us food and clothing and shelter, friends and family, and most importantly, someone to save us from our sins. </p>
<p>And now he simply says, &#8220;Trust me. Trust that all you have comes from me. Trust that I will provide all that you need for your body and soul. Trust that your sins are forgiven through Jesus and eternal life is yours.&#8221; </p>
<p>We did not earn any of these blessings. God was not obligated to give them. But he has, and he does. They are all his free gifts.</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s Bible reading, we are told about Jesus meeting a Samaritan woman at the well outside of the town in which she lived. It was just the two of them. No one else was there and it&#8217;s easy to understand why.</p>
<p>It was noon—not the typical time to get water from the town well. You see, to get water from the well, you had to carry your bucket from home, hope there was enough water in the 100-foot deep well, lower your bucket, lift it back up, and carry the heavy load home. This was not a job you wanted to do at the hottest time of the day!</p>
<p>But it is what this woman did because that was easier than going to the well when it was crowded with people, people who knew the kind of life she had lived, the kind of life she was now living. Everyone knew she was living a life of sin, which is why Jesus offered her a glass of spiritual water. He knew she was thirsty. Not for water but for forgiveness.</p>
<p>We are too. There are certain things about our lives and certain desires that creep into our hearts we would prefer to keep hidden from everyone. But just as Jesus knew this woman&#8217;s sin, he also already knows each of ours.</p>
<p>And he offers us the refreshing gift of forgiveness. Just as the woman didn&#8217;t ask Jesus for water that day, neither did we ask Jesus to offer his perfect life as the sacrifice to pay for all of our sins. Yet that&#8217;s exactly what he did.</p>
<p>Whatever sin in your past is parching your soul, find refreshment in the fact that it is already forgiven. </p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Father in heaven, you know my heart and are aware of every sin. Let me never forget the gift of forgiveness already won for me by Jesus. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>Did you know there is a condition you can have that makes it impossible not to be thirsty? It&#8217;s called polydipsia. If you have polydipsia, you will feel thirsty most or all of the time, and will not be able to quench your thirst, no matter how much you drink. Polydipsia affects roughly 10 million Americans.</p>
<p>The spiritual form of polydipsia affects many more. &#8220;Polydipsia of the soul&#8221; isn&#8217;t a real medical diagnosis. Yet many individuals in the world feel less than satisfied in their souls. They feel unfulfilled, disgruntled, angry, unhappy, or guilty—believing that something or someone needs to change for them to feel satisfied again.</p>
<p>Jesus met a woman like this one day by a well of water, and he made her a remarkable promise. &#8220;Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.&#8221; But Jesus wasn&#8217;t talking about physical water. He was talking about spiritual water. He wanted her to see the significant man standing right in front of her. He wanted her to see the Savior who refreshes guilty souls with the assurance of forgiveness, the God who refreshes tired hearts with the joy of knowing they have a Father in heaven who loves them, and the Friend who refreshes weary souls with the truth that heaven has already been won for them on the cross.</p>
<p>Come to Jesus. Satisfy your soul on his everlasting love and his gracious promises. Come, and you will find refreshment for your soul.</p>

<p>Everyone who has a job looks forward to payday. After putting in all those hours of work, you receive your paycheck. It is something that is owed to you. You and your employer came to the agreement that you would work for an amount of time and, in return, your employer would give you an amount of money.</p>
<p>In this section of Paul&#8217;s letter to the Romans, he uses that same picture. If you work, you are owed something. However, he shows us that, when it comes to salvation and heaven, it is not something that we are owed, but comes as a gift from God.</p>
<p>Paul says elsewhere in this letter, &#8220;The wages of sin is death&#8221; (Romans 6:23). We deserve to be punished by God for all eternity because of our sins. This includes every single time we have had thoughts that were wrong or said things that we shouldn&#8217;t have. If you want to talk about something we are owed, this is it! We deserve eternal death.</p>
<p>However, as Paul points out, when we are brought to believe in Jesus as our Savior, then we are in a right relationship with God. Even this faith that we have is not our own doing. We cannot choose to believe in Jesus. This only comes through the work of the Holy Spirit as we hear God&#8217;s Word.</p>
<p>God owes us nothing. Yet, he gives us everything. Isn&#8217;t it wonderful to know that God does not give us what we deserve!</p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Heavenly Father, thank you for not giving me what I deserve. Thank you for giving me what Jesus earned for me. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>The words must have pierced Abraham&#8217;s soul. Isaac didn&#8217;t mean to wound his father, and under most circumstances, his question wouldn&#8217;t have been wounding words. But these were not normal circumstances. God asked a father to offer his only son as an offering to him. It was a test. God wanted to see whom Abraham loved more—his child or his Lord.</p>
<p>Children can ask questions that get to the point and leave adults fumbling for an answer. That&#8217;s Isaac on that day with his father. He loved and trusted his dear father so much! With honest eyes and a gentle voice, he asked, &#8220;Father, where&#8217;s the lamb?&#8221;</p>
<p>What would Abraham tell his son? Out of love for his dear son, he couldn&#8217;t bluntly say, &#8220;Isaac, you&#8217;re the lamb this time.&#8221; He couldn&#8217;t lie and say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; What would he say, and how would he say it? Holding his son close to him and the Lord&#8217;s promises even closer, Abraham breathed deeply and declared, &#8220;God himself will provide.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what happened. God himself provided an offering that day—and the offering was not Isaac. Once God knew he had Abraham&#8217;s full trust, the Lord provided an animal instead of Isaac for the sacrifice.</p>
<p>That day pointed ahead to another day when another Father would offer his one and only Son as a sacrifice. His Son&#8217;s name is Jesus whose sacrifice on the cross paid for all sin. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Father’s love—and the Son&#8217;s trust—that you find on the cross! Don&#8217;t ever wonder if God loves you. He provided his own Son, the perfect Lamb of God, as an offering. He was willing to give up his Son so he would have you forever.</p>

Thank you, O my Father, for giving your Son as a sacrifice in my place.

<p>The devil had Jesus right where he wanted him, or so it would seem. Matthew calls the devil, &#8220;the tempter.&#8221; That word tells us that Satan was intent on doing evil to Jesus. He wanted to lead Jesus to sin and rob the world of the Savior. Satan was attacking Jesus but he was really declaring war on all of us. His goal is to take away our salvation. If Jesus was not perfectly sinless, he could not give us his perfection. Make no mistake, Satan intended to destroy us that day. He was not playing around.</p>
<p>He is still not playing around today. Do we always realize that the stakes are so high? We often get caught up in life and forget just how serious the situation is. We aren&#8217;t always ready to fight temptation. We often don&#8217;t give a second thought to how Satan might attack us today. This lack of preparedness gets us into trouble. Too often we fall into sin simply because we are not ready for battle.</p>
<p>How important it is, then, for us to focus on Jesus who has already done battle with Satan and won. Jesus has been where we are. He faced every temptation the devil threw at him. But there is a big difference between Jesus and us. The Bible says, &#8220;…we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin.&#8221; Our Savior never once caved in to Satan&#8217;s pressure. Never once gave into the devil&#8217;s temptations or was unprepared. He perfectly fought the battle. He was victorious, for us.</p>
<p>Jesus has given us victory over Satan. The devil can no longer harm us as we trust in Jesus. Satan&#8217;s plans to destroy our souls have been defeated by our Savior. In Jesus, we are forgiven and saved. In Jesus, we now have the tools to fend off Satan&#8217;s attacks. With faith in Jesus and depending on his Word, we can be ready for whatever Satan throws our way.</p>

</div>
<p>Sometimes in life, we are just overmatched. Our opponent or enemy is just too strong, too big, too much for us to handle. The Alamo is certainly one such example. Fewer than 200 men stood fighting against an army of 1,500. They knew they were overmatched and could not win. They knew no reinforcements were coming.</p>
<p>It certainly seems like Jesus was overmatched in his battle against the devil. For one thing, he was in the wilderness—a place where he was isolated. Nobody was coming to his aid. There would be no reinforcements. He was on his own. He was on Satan&#8217;s turf. And while he was out there, he was fasting. Physically, he was drained.</p>
<p>You know how that feels, don&#8217;t you—to be spiritually overmatched? You feel like you are on your own and the devil keeps on coming. He tempts you with doubt: &#8220;If God really loved you, why did he let this happen to you?&#8221; &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t God want you to be happy? He must not really mean what he says in his Word. Go ahead, live the way you want.&#8221; And he keeps coming. Temptation after temptation.</p>
<p>Like the Texans at the Alamo, you can’t win. You may fight for a little while, but in the end, you are overrun by the devil&#8217;s temptations and defeated. You have lost too many battles and have fallen into sin over the same old familiar temptations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember the Alamo!&#8221; That was the rallying cry in the war following the famous battle. Our rallying cry is different: Remember Jesus! He went to battle for you. He crushed the devil and defeated all your enemies. Through his death on the cross, he forgives your sins and gives you the gift of heaven. He also gives you the weapons to defeat the devil in your daily life.</p>
<p>Thank God for sending Jesus. And get to know his Word, so that you can say no to temptation and remain on the way to heaven.</p>

</div>
<p>The first man created by God had disobeyed him. He had eaten fruit God had forbidden. When God gave him an opportunity to confess what he had done, Adam said, &#8220;The woman you put here with me―she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.&#8221; That&#8217;s not exactly a confession, is it? Sure, Adam begrudgingly admitted the sin. But he was also quick to blame both Eve and God for putting him in that situation. </p>
<p>I suppose we want to shake our heads at Adam&#8217;s attempt to blame his wife and his God for his own sin. But then we remember we aren&#8217;t any different. We too have played the blame game. As children, we point the finger at our sibling and shout: &#8220;He made me do it!&#8221; As adults, we blame society for our loose morals. We blame work and our social life for not getting to church. We blame the coworker&#8217;s attitude for our harsh thoughts and words in the workplace. We blame our busy lives for not spending enough time in God&#8217;s Word. We blame our upbringing for the sinful choices we continue to make. God calls out, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; And, unfortunately, we are too often lost in sin and blaming others for it.</p>
<p>Would it surprise you to find out that God played his own version of the blame game? No, he didn&#8217;t blame someone else for what he had done wrong. He blamed someone else for what WE have done wrong. The Bible says, &#8220;God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.&#8221; God blamed Jesus for all our sins so that we could be forgiven and saved. On the cross, Jesus suffered the punishment our sins deserve and through him, we have eternal life.</p>
<p>Because of Jesus, you and I stand blameless before God.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out; come out, wherever you are!&#8221; Anyone who has ever played hide-and-seek has heard someone shout those words. Who would ever have imagined God saying those words in the Garden of Eden? But then again, this wasn&#8217;t a game, was it? Adam and Eve weren&#8217;t playing a fun game of hide-and-seek.  They weren&#8217;t having any fun at all.</p>
<p>Something had gone terribly wrong in that perfect place of paradise. Adam and Eve had sinned. They had broken their relationship with God and had gone their own way and they knew it was a terrible mistake. Something that had once given them great joy now sent them running for the trees. Accustomed to walking and talking with God in the garden, Adam and Eve now felt guilt and fear and they hid from God.</p>
<p>Where are you hiding? Are you hiding from God at work? Maybe by working so many hours, you don&#8217;t have time to pray or confess to God. Where are you hiding? On a website? In the gym? During sleepless nights? What is it that you don&#8217;t want to bring out into the light of day? Secret thoughts or desires…selfish behavior…lack of love toward God. Sadly, like Adam, you and I are often not looking for God―even though he is waiting right there for us!</p>
<p>Note the love and grace of God. &#8220;But the Lord God called to the man, &#8216;Where are you?’&#8221; God&#8217;s love caused him to seek and to find the sinner who was hiding. In love, God seeks us out too. He invites us to come to him. God sent Jesus to die in our place on the cross and to remove everything that would make us hide. In Jesus, our sins are forever washed away. We are clean. We don&#8217;t need to hide. We can come to our Father in heaven and know that in Jesus, we are safe.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Dear Father in heaven, thank you for seeking me out. Thank you for forgiveness in Jesus. Help me to run to you, trusting in your love for me. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>
