<p>What kind of relationship do you have with God? Do you wonder at times—especially when you feel the guilt of a certain sin? What does a person do at such a time? Some try to run away from God. But it doesn’t work to run away from guilt.</p>
<p>Far better is to follow the instruction of the prophet Hosea: &#8220;Come, let us return to the L<span style="font-size: small;">ORD</span>.&#8221; Even though we have so often sinned against him, God wants us to come back to him. He sometimes even allows us to experience the consequences of our sins so that we wake up and realize we have gone in the wrong direction. His intent is that we wake up and return to him. When we do, he forgives us for the sake of his Son, Jesus, who lived and died to earn forgiveness for us.</p>
<p>His goal is, &#8220;That we may live in his presence.&#8221; Isn&#8217;t that something? The almighty, eternal God of the universe wants you with him. What joy! What comfort! It is wonderful to know that, through Jesus, you can spend this day with the Lord, and to know that he wants to and will spend his day with you. How could you have anything but a great day?</p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Heavenly Father, you know that I struggle and sin every day. Amazingly you also forgive me every day. Impress this good news on my heart so that I remain faithful to you, even during the difficult times of my life. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>In the fall of 1985 a 45-ton humpbacked whale, supposedly heading for the warmer ocean water to the south, made its way into the San Francisco Bay, swam up the Sacramento River, and &#8220;landed&#8221; in a slough. A great deal of effort was required to get it back to its original habitat.</p>
<p>Human beings also go off course at times. One who did so deliberately was the prophet, Jonah. God had called him to preach the Word in Nineveh, the pagan capital of the Assyrian Empire. But like the whale, he got into the wrong channel. Instead of going east to Nineveh, he boarded a freighter at Joppa and sailed west on a ship that was bound for Tarshish on the other end of the Mediterranean Sea. But God put Jonah back on course. During a severe storm, Jonah was cast overboard and was swallowed by a large fish. Preserved alive, the prophet heeded the second call from God and preached repentance in Nineveh.</p>
<p>Jesus referred to Jonah&#8217;s experience and applied it to himself: &#8220;As Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth&#8221; (Matthew 12:40). By being crucified, buried, and raised from the dead, Jesus Christ put a lost and floundering humanity back on course—the course of salvation by faith in him.</p>

<p>What would it be like for an adult who was born blind suddenly to be able to see? They might look upon their family and friends for the first time but not even recognize them! They might struggle for a while to connect their newfound vision to the more familiar worlds of sound and touch. But what a wonderful challenge! How much fun they would have trying to make sense out of everything they could now see around them!</p>
<p>Jesus gave this gift to a man that we read about in the gospel of John. The Bible doesn&#8217;t tell us much about the man&#8217;s adjustment to being able to see but rather describes a different transition from blindness to sight. Through his encounter with Jesus, the formerly blind man also gained the gift of spiritual sight, which was faith in his Savior. His spiritual vision wasn&#8217;t perfect right away—he didn&#8217;t even recognize that God&#8217;s Son was standing right in front of him. But he was eager to learn and put his new sight into practice by worshiping the one who opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Whenever people are brought to faith by the Holy Spirit through the Word of God, it is like helping them to see for the first time. They see God as he truly is—gracious, merciful, and powerful to save. They see themselves as God sees them—as sinners who are loved anyway for the sake of Jesus. They may not see everything clearly right away. It takes time to adjust to this new vision. But what a blessing to spend the rest of your life learning to see things the way God sees them!</p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Dear Father in heaven, don&#8217;t let me take my vision for granted—either physical or spiritual sight. Open my eyes to see people and things as you see them. Help me always to keep my eyes focused on Jesus as my one true Savior. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>In the part of the world where I am privileged to serve, power outages are not uncommon. Backup batteries and power generators can buy extra time, but eventually, they also run out of charge or fuel. As soon as the power goes out, we know to quickly save any work we are doing on the computer or all may be lost once the battery dies. There may be other tasks to be done by candlelight, but any computer work is done for the day!</p>
<p>Missionaries and evangelists have been sent throughout the world with the life-saving, life-giving message of the gospel. Many people have been brought to faith in Jesus through their efforts, but there is much more work to be done. Sadly, in some countries, the open window of opportunity for evangelism may be rapidly closing. The gospel is still powerful to save, but anti-Christian governments and cultural movements increasingly hinder the work of those who preach Christ crucified. These missionaries know that they must &#8220;work while it is day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesus made the most of every opportunity he had while he was on earth. He accomplished everything his Father sent him to do, reaching out to the lost, comforting those who mourned, healing both bodies and souls. And then when the time came, he laid down his life for us so that we might live with him.</p>
<p>Do you know someone who still doesn&#8217;t know the peace of forgiveness in Jesus? Perhaps you have been waiting for just the right time to speak with them about our Savior. I want to encourage you not to wait any longer. Our time in this world is a lot shorter than any of us realize. The opportunity to speak today may no longer be there tomorrow. Keep in mind the hope and joy you have from knowing what Jesus Christ has done for you. Wouldn&#8217;t you want others to have those same blessings? And wouldn&#8217;t they appreciate having that peace sooner rather than later?</p>

<p>You are probably familiar with the concept of karma. Some people explain karma as: &#8220;What goes around comes around.&#8221; If you do good, good things will come your way. If you do evil, watch out! But is this truly the way things work? What have you observed in your life or the lives of others? Are people always rewarded for their good deeds? Do evildoers always suffer the consequences of their actions?</p>
<p>Jesus&#8217; disciples didn&#8217;t believe in karma, but they did assume that suffering was the result of evil actions. They were puzzled, then, when they came across a man who was born blind. How could he have done something so bad in the womb as to deserve a life of blindness? But if his parents were the ones cursed with a blind son because of their sin, how was that fair to the child?</p>
<p>Jesus told his disciples that the blindness wasn&#8217;t the consequence for a specific sin committed by either the man or his parents. In reality, the consequences of sin are far worse. The Bible tells us that &#8220;the wages of sin is death.&#8221; The punishment for disobeying God is complete separation from the source of life for all eternity. This is what we all had coming to us. The Bible tells us, &#8220;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Lord does not treat us according to what we have done. Instead, he shows mercy to all who repent. God&#8217;s works of love are displayed in us when he calls us to see that his Son, Jesus has already taken our punishment upon himself. God treats believers as his children, with love and care, even though we have not earned that status ourselves. His blessings to us are a gift. We may still suffer while we are in this fallen world, but the Lord will one day rescue us from it all and take us to himself in glory.</p>

<p>Ten-year-old Mason was feeling frustrated and a little desperate. The boy had been trying to get his father&#8217;s attention during breakfast to explain that he needed a parent to sign a permission slip for school. Today was the class field trip. And although Mason knew he had been misbehaving recently—and was even grounded all last week–he was still hopeful that dad would give him permission to go. Mason pleaded with his father, &#8220;Dad, please? I&#8217;ve done all my chores this week as Mom asked me to. I promise I&#8217;ll behave!&#8221; Dad, however, was distracted by an ongoing group text with his boss and a co-worker about an important project they were presenting that day. In his frustration, Mason almost shouted at his father: &#8220;Dad, did you hear what I said?!&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike earthly parents, our heavenly Father is never too busy or distracted to hear our cries for help. But still, it so often seems that when we pray there is no answer—or at least, not the answer we hoped for. So how can we convince God to answer our requests for help? Can we, like young Mason, point to the good things we have done or offer promises to improve? Will our good deeds sway a holy God and move him to bless his obedient children? Sadly, no. We must confess with the psalm writer, &#8220;No one living is righteous before you.&#8221; As one pastor has warned, &#8220;Never pray for God to give you only what you deserve—you won&#8217;t like the result.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather, listen to how the writer of this psalm appeals to God&#8217;s mercy. It is the Lord&#8217;s loving-kindness that moves him to rescue us. We have not been faithful to God, but he has kept his promises to us. He forgives us for the sake of his Son, Jesus Christ. So we pray in Jesus&#8217; name, reminding the Lord of the sacrifice he made so that we might become his children.</p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>

Lord God, only you can rescue me from the many troubles in my life. I ask you to help me because you are a kind and loving Father and not because I have earned or deserved it. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>To be &#8220;in the dark&#8221; means that you are unaware of the truth about something. And if someone &#8220;sheds some light&#8221; on the subject, that means they helped you to understand what you didn&#8217;t know before.</p>
<p>But for the Christians in the city of Ephesus, the apostle Paul extended the metaphor to the extreme. Paul told those believers that in their past not only were they in the dark about God and his will for their lives, but they were the darkness! They had so deeply swallowed the lies of godlessness and the empty temptations of this world that they became a corrupting influence in the lives of others as well.</p>
<p>All of us were born in the same darkness of sin and unbelief. None of us came into this world knowing the truth about God&#8217;s love for us. And our sinful human nature actively works to try to keep us in that spiritual darkness. When we follow those self-destructive patterns in our lives, we can cause others around us to stumble too.</p>
<p>But the light of Christ shines brightly to scatter the darkness. Jesus Christ came to reveal the truth about God, about ourselves, and about how we have been made right with God through the sacrifice of his Son. The Holy Spirit enlightens our hearts through this good news and leads us to rejoice in what it means for us.</p>
<p>Just as those in the dark are darkness to others, so those in the light of Christ also become a source of light. Christians have learned what kind of living pleases God: a life full of love and compassion for others, a life that seeks to serve God and our neighbor, a life that revolves around the truth of our Savior, Jesus. When we walk according to the light of the Bible, our actions and attitudes serve as beacons for others, calling them to know the will of God for their lives and how true spiritual light is found in Jesus.</p>

<p>Remember those miners in Chile who were trapped underground for 69 days back in 2010? Picture them before the first small drill broke through: running out of food, water, and light as batteries died… trapped in darkness so deep in the earth. It might be fun to visit and explore a cave, but it must be terrifying to be trapped in the dark, totally dependent upon someone else to rescue you.</p>
<p>Imagine being caught in an even worse never-ending darkness! That&#8217;s the darkness of being separated from God, of being trapped in sin and captive to eternal death. It is the darkness into which all of us were born, the Bible tells us. </p>
<p>But Jesus broke through that dense darkness with the bright light of salvation which he accomplished by his suffering and death for us all. Through his Word, God has called us out of the darkness of unbelief into the wonderful light of faith in Jesus. God has turned us from darkness into being &#8220;light in the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now he calls upon us to live in that light, to let our faith shine. In thanks to Jesus for rescuing us from the darkness of hell, we let the brightness of Christ shine through us and expose the darkness around us. Jesus has made us beacons of light to those still in spiritual darkness. For his sake, we will seek to live in ways that please our God, being as good, decent, and honest as we possibly can. And light up the world with the good news of Jesus.</p>
<p>As his believers, it&#8217;s time to shine!</p>

<p>Someone is always watching you. Are you okay with that?</p>
<p>Many facilities, both public and private, are equipped with video surveillance systems. They see, and may even record, where and when you come in and go out. They watch what you are doing and how you are doing it. Are you okay with that?</p>
<p>As you use your mobile phone and data plan or surf the internet, where you go and what you do may be tracked and recorded for future reference and analysis. Websites track your patterns and habits. Retailers note when, how, where, and what you shop for.</p>
<p>Your cell phone use and your cell signal can be monitored. The methods and the technology for watching where you go and what you do continue to evolve. Are you okay with that?</p>
<p>Sometimes we don&#8217;t realize that things like video surveillance and online tracking are taking place. At other times we realize it is happening, but don&#8217;t give it much thought. Here&#8217;s a truth worth thinking about—all the time: The Lord is watching over your coming and going. He is watching over you right now, at every moment, all the time.</p>
<p>Whether you realize it or not, whether you think about it or not, the Lord is watching over your life. The God of faithful love is watching over you and keeping you from harm. The God who loves you does not slumber nor sleep. He is always looking to bless you.</p>
<p>What a wonderful comfort! While you are awake and when you are sleeping, when you are coming and when you are going, no matter where you are or what you are doing, the Lord is watching over you. The Maker of heaven and earth who has made you his child in Christ is there to help you every step of the way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m absolutely okay with that. I hope you are too.</p>

And give me peace eternally. Amen.<br />

<p>People sometimes become frustrated with God because they don&#8217;t feel their faith is working in the way it should.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried going to church and doing the right things. But life is still really hard, and God doesn&#8217;t seem to be changing anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried not to worry and to stop trying to control everything, but it seems that only left me with fewer answers and more questions. It&#8217;s not working, and I don’t think it should be so hard to follow him.&#8221; But sometimes it is. And if it ever is for you, then look at Abram.</p>
<p>Abram received many wonderful promises from God but saw precious few of those promises fulfilled during his lifetime. Abram&#8217;s family didn&#8217;t take possession of the land God promised him until 430 years later. Abram was long dead by then. And this &#8220;great nation&#8221; that he would make Abram to be; when Abram died, had exactly one son and two 15-year-old grandchildren; none of whom were the Savior of the world, which is exactly what God was talking about when he said that &#8220;all people on earth will be blessed through [him].&#8221;</p>
<p>Abram would never see, during his life on earth, most of the blessings God promised him. Yet he still went where God commanded him, even when it was hard because he trusted God to keep his word.</p>
<p>You can trust his word too. Even when things aren&#8217;t going the way you would like, even when God seems slow in keeping his promises to you, you can trust he will. After all, he kept his greatest promise when he sent his Son into the world to save you from your sins.<em> If he was willing to keep that promise, you can be sure he will keep all the rest.</em></p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>

Father in heaven, strengthen my faith in you by keeping me focused on your faithfulness to me in Jesus. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>Consider some of the promises Abraham believed in, as repeated by the Apostle Paul in the book of Romans. Paul called Abraham&#8217;s God the &#8220;God who justifies the wicked.&#8221; To justify means to declare &#8220;not guilty.&#8221; And if God saw the wicked things Abraham did and called him not guilty of them, then Abraham had the right to walk through life believing that God was never going to punish him for anything.</p>
<p>Paul said that Abraham&#8217;s God is the one who &#8220;gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they are,&#8221; which means that Abraham had the right to look at death and expect life. He had the right to look at situations that aren&#8217;t good and expect that good will still come from them.</p>
<p>Paul also said that these promises are &#8220;guaranteed to all Abraham&#8217;s offspring,&#8221; and he defines Abraham&#8217;s offspring not as those who are of the same bloodline as him, but as anyone who has the same faith Abraham did.</p>
<p>If you believe in the same God Abraham did, it means that whenever death claims your body, it won&#8217;t be the end since your God brings life from death. And since he calls things that are not as though they are, then you also have the right to look at situations that are not good and believe that some good will still come from them.</p>
<p>And remember, all of these promises are &#8220;guaranteed.&#8221; They were guaranteed through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, who perfectly fulfilled every promise God made about him.</p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Father in heaven, help me to hold on to your remarkable promises so that I stand firm in my faith. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>There is a difference between a gift and an obligation.</p>
<p>If you have a job and put in your required hours, your boss has an obligation to give you a paycheck. The paycheck is earned. But a gift is given under no obligation. The recipient did not earn it.</p>
<p>This is the point the Bible makes about Abraham. God was not obligated to bless him. Abraham was &#8220;ungodly&#8221; in many of the same ways we are. He was imperfect, sinned, and fell short of doing all that God requires. God was under no obligation to bless Abraham, and he is under no obligation to bless us.</p>
<p>And yet he did bless Abraham. He gave him great wealth and fame. He made him the father of a great nation. And, most importantly, he made him the ancestor of Jesus, the Savior of the world.</p>
<p>God has done the same for us. Although he is under no obligation to bless us, he has. He has given us food and clothing and shelter, friends and family, and most importantly, someone to save us from our sins. </p>
<p>And now he simply says, &#8220;Trust me. Trust that all you have comes from me. Trust that I will provide all that you need for your body and soul. Trust that your sins are forgiven through Jesus and eternal life is yours.&#8221; </p>
<p>We did not earn any of these blessings. God was not obligated to give them. But he has, and he does. They are all his free gifts.</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s Bible reading, we are told about Jesus meeting a Samaritan woman at the well outside of the town in which she lived. It was just the two of them. No one else was there and it&#8217;s easy to understand why.</p>
<p>It was noon—not the typical time to get water from the town well. You see, to get water from the well, you had to carry your bucket from home, hope there was enough water in the 100-foot deep well, lower your bucket, lift it back up, and carry the heavy load home. This was not a job you wanted to do at the hottest time of the day!</p>
<p>But it is what this woman did because that was easier than going to the well when it was crowded with people, people who knew the kind of life she had lived, the kind of life she was now living. Everyone knew she was living a life of sin, which is why Jesus offered her a glass of spiritual water. He knew she was thirsty. Not for water but for forgiveness.</p>
<p>We are too. There are certain things about our lives and certain desires that creep into our hearts we would prefer to keep hidden from everyone. But just as Jesus knew this woman&#8217;s sin, he also already knows each of ours.</p>
<p>And he offers us the refreshing gift of forgiveness. Just as the woman didn&#8217;t ask Jesus for water that day, neither did we ask Jesus to offer his perfect life as the sacrifice to pay for all of our sins. Yet that&#8217;s exactly what he did.</p>
<p>Whatever sin in your past is parching your soul, find refreshment in the fact that it is already forgiven. </p>
<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Prayer:</strong><br />
Father in heaven, you know my heart and are aware of every sin. Let me never forget the gift of forgiveness already won for me by Jesus. Amen.<div  style='height:25px' class='hr hr-invisible  '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div></p></blockquote>

<p>Did you know there is a condition you can have that makes it impossible not to be thirsty? It&#8217;s called polydipsia. If you have polydipsia, you will feel thirsty most or all of the time, and will not be able to quench your thirst, no matter how much you drink. Polydipsia affects roughly 10 million Americans.</p>
<p>The spiritual form of polydipsia affects many more. &#8220;Polydipsia of the soul&#8221; isn&#8217;t a real medical diagnosis. Yet many individuals in the world feel less than satisfied in their souls. They feel unfulfilled, disgruntled, angry, unhappy, or guilty—believing that something or someone needs to change for them to feel satisfied again.</p>
<p>Jesus met a woman like this one day by a well of water, and he made her a remarkable promise. &#8220;Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.&#8221; But Jesus wasn&#8217;t talking about physical water. He was talking about spiritual water. He wanted her to see the significant man standing right in front of her. He wanted her to see the Savior who refreshes guilty souls with the assurance of forgiveness, the God who refreshes tired hearts with the joy of knowing they have a Father in heaven who loves them, and the Friend who refreshes weary souls with the truth that heaven has already been won for them on the cross.</p>
<p>Come to Jesus. Satisfy your soul on his everlasting love and his gracious promises. Come, and you will find refreshment for your soul.</p>
